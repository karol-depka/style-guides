Web Project Stylue Guides
=========================

In this repository I try to collect all information about how to create a
web project efficiently and in best practices. You can find here:

* [**Web Project Structure Style Guides**](structure.md):  
    which collect information on how to build best practice web project structures,
* [**HTML and CSS Style Guides**](html-and-css.md):  
    which are basically the Google Design Guides for these topics,
* [**JavaScript Style Guides**](javascript.md):  
    which describe how to use JavaScript in best practices,
* [**AngularJS 1.x Style Guides**](angularjs.md):  
    which are basically the _John Papa_ style guides for AngularJS 1.x,
* [**Git Best Practices and Style Guides**](git.md) (Comming soon):  
    which define Best Practices for working with Git,
* etc.
