Web Project Stylue Guides
=========================

In this repository I try to collect all information about how to create a
web project efficiently and in best practices. You can find here:

* **HTML and CSS Style Guides**
    which are basically the Google Design Guides for these topics,
    ([Link](./blob/master/html-and-css.md))
* **JavaScript Style Guides**
    which describe how to use JavaScript in best practices,
    ([Link](./blob/master/javascript.md))
